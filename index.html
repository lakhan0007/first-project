        and that is why it is essential that we conserve it. Water is the basic necessity for all living beings,
        and it is incredibly important to conserve it. It is not only important for living and breathing things,
        but also for many inanimate objects that humans create. For example, to build a house, we need concrete, 
        and to make concrete, we need to mix cement powder with water. Water constitutes more than 70 percent of
        the Earth’s surface, and yet we do not have enough water for our needs.
        It is essential to conserve and save water for ourselves and the entire planet Earth<br>
        “Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.” You must have heard this phrase many times in your life.<del>water of true</del>
        It means that although there is water all around us, in Earth’s oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, etc., most of 
        <ins>it is not drinkable water!</ins> The oceans cover up more than 70 percent of all of the Earth’s surface, which is
        why it is very easy to raise the question – then why do we say that there is a shortage of water? It is
        because the water in the oceans is so salty that it is not safe to drink it.<br><br>
        <abbr title="world helth Organization">WHO</abbr>, we must rely upon the other sources of water that the Earth provides us, from the rivers that come 
        from glaciers. However, we must also remember that this water is limited, and will exhaust a few decades
        down the line. Therefore, it is very important to use this water responsibly and do everything we can to 
        avoid wasting it. While there is a lot of water now, if we keep on using water for unnecessary things or
        wasting it, there won’t be much left around the world.
        What if the water in the world finishes? Aquatic life such as fish, coral reefs, seahorses, etc. will
        not be able to survive, because they will lose their habitats. We humans will not survive because our 
        bodies are made up of 70% water, and without it, we cannot sustain ourselves. All the plants and animals
        around us will become extinct too. The Earth, which is a planet characterized by its ability to house life
        will not be what it is now.There are several ways to save water, and they are very easy to inculcate in our
        daily lives. We must not leave the tap water running when we are putting soap while washing our hands. 
        We can use buckets to take a bath rather than use the shower, no flushing of the toilet unnecessarily,
        always finishing the water in our glasses instead of throwing it away, etc. There are many more ways 
        <i> to save water, too, but these are just some of them for us to understand the little things that 
        can be done.</i> water formula H<sub>2</sub>o. <a href="https://www.aplustopper.com/article-on-save-water/" target="_blank">Read More</a></P> -->
